# Lonely-Slime-Game
My team nad I came out with this game idea for the theme 'Out of Control' that was presented to us by GMTK Gam Jam 2020 where we made this game within 48 hours. This is the more refined version and we've changed a lot of mechanics to make the game much more playable with little to no bugs at all.
